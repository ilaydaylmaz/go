# User Management Project
This project is a simple user management application with a backend written in Go and a frontend written in TypeScript using React and Next.js. The application allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on user data through a web interface.

## Project Structure
1. Backend (Go):
The backend is responsible for handling user data and exposing RESTful APIs for CRUD operations.
Database: SQLite is used for persistent storage.
Entry point: main.go

2. Frontend (TypeScript with React and Next.js):
The frontend provides a user interface for interacting with the backend.
The master view lists all users and supports CRUD operations.
The detailed view shows user details and allows users to perform specific actions.
